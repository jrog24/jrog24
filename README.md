### Welcome to my almost empty GitHub ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on IoT stuff, mainly Arduino and ESP32. I also do some C# coding and occasionally take on webdev. Also working on @Project-Trains.
<br>
<b>Current major project</b>: ESP32 Weather Station with webserver and cloud storage of data using HTML/CSS and IBM Cloud
<br>
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on literally anything that involves IoT and/or C/C++/C#.
<br>
ðŸ’» I know basics of these programming languages:
- PHP,
- HTML/CSS,
- Ruby on Rails,
- Python
<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I love The Office
